        <h1 >Mexico</h1>
        <p>The area of ​​Mexico is estimated at 1,972,547 square kilometers, ninety times the area of ​​the State of Israel. 
            The Spanish language is the official language of Mexico, but in places, farther from the center of the country, you can find other languages, fifty different languages ​​of Native Americans. 
            Mexican English speakers can be found easily, but it is not true to say this about all of Mexico. 
            Mostly rural and you should know a little basic Spanish to get by.</p>
